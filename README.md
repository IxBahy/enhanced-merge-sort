# enhanced-merge-sort
## run the script by typing ' node main.js ' in the terminal
here I used : -Binary search -Insertion sort -merge sort

normal insertion is faster then merge until the n is >=43

Binary insertion sort is a sorting algorithm mixing the normal insertion sort with Rbinary search algorithm it helps with improving the constant

as that the speed of binaryInsertion is faster then merge sort while n<55 so i used the binary insertion on tje small blocks of array in size less then 55 then merged the bigger ones resulting in a better constant but its still O(n lg n)
